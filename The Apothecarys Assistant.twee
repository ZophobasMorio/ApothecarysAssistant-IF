:: About {"position":"500,300","size":"100,100"}
//The Apothecary's Assistant// was written and designed in Twine/Sugarcube by Allyson Gray.

Much credit goes to the wonderful Alex Parker for his tireless playtesting, his invaluable technical contributions and his constant moral support!

The author can be reached at allyson_gray@hotmail.com or on <a href="https://intfiction.org/u/ally/summary" target="_blank">the intfiction forum</a> for any issues, questions, comments or other feedback. Messages are always welcome and appreciated!
When any major updates are made, all versions of the game will be available <a href="https://zophobas-morio.itch.io/apothecary" target="_blank">on itch.io</a>.

''A note about save files''

Frequent autosaves will be stored in the first save slot, but manual saves can also be made. If you plan to clear your browser's cache or if you'd like to switch the browser or device that you play on, the "Export" or "Save to Disk" options should allow you to safeguard and/or transfer your data.

There seems to be an issue with the settings of certain systems (notably Mac/iOs with Safari) which wipes out Twine save files from the browser's cache, either immediately or after 7 days of absence — if that applies to you, you might have to "Save to Disk" or "Export" every time you're done playing.
It's recommended for all players to back up their saves to the disk occasionally, just in case!

Progress is typically autosaved after each shift, or upon fully completing any post-shift action.

''A note about accessibility''

Unfortunately some aspects of the game are not fully accessible to people with certain vision impairments, and there wasn't enough time before IFComp to find alternatives. I apologize for this and I hope to find a way to make the game accessible for all in a post-comp release!


:: Apology {"position":"4400,1900","size":"100,100"}
Kneeling in front of each figure successively, she takes a stunning boubou out of her satchel and respectfully holds it up.

"I made these for you."

The tall figure hesitates for a moment, then slowly reaches out to touch the dark blue satin. Raising the garment up near where you suppose her face is, she seems to admire the details intricately woven in golden thread.

The shorter figure grasps the red and gold boubou with both hands, gently stroking the fabric with his thumbs.

Aïssatou backs away and pulls out a neatly-folded piece of paper. Her voice is filled with nervousness as she unfolds it and starts to read.

"Mamadou, Seynabou,

I am ashamed that it has taken me so long to recognize the rights that you deserve.
Surrounded by other yumboes who never questioned their lifestyles, I remained blissfully ignorant of your struggles. I thought that simply not being cruel was enough. That the natural order of things should not be questioned. I thought myself kind and benevolent. But later on, even as I helped other beings break free of the chains of their circumstances, I had a blind spot in my treatment of you. I still felt entitled to your work. In truth we were always equals in every way that matters, and I wish I could have realized it sooner.
I was extremely hurtful in my carelessness, and I sincerely apologize..."

Her voice slowly trails off. She looks up and quickly rubs her eyes, then slips the paper into the satchel and hesitantly holds the latter out towards Mamadou and Seynabou.

"There is more, if you'd like to read it... I've also left some acorns in there for you."

Mamadou wordlessly reaches out and takes it. Aïssatou, flustered, continues to speak.

"You don't have to ever come back to the apothecary if you don't want to, but please don't feel the need to hide away. You are full-fledged members of our community, and if you need anything, everyone will have your backs."

There is a long silence, as if no one quite knows what to do. Finally, Seynabou speaks up, her melodic voice shaky with emotion.

"Thank you, Aïssatou. I think that Mamadou and I have much to discuss before making any decisions, but we will get in touch with you again. To be honest, we rather impulsively set out to test you, and we were not expecting this development..."

She hugs the boubou to her chest and you hear a smile in her voice as she continues:

"But this is much better than solving some puzzles!"

Aïssatou laughs nervously, and everyone waves as the two start to take their leave. Before turning away, they call out to you:

"Take care, new assistant!"
"Don't let Aïssatou slack off!"

Still recovering from her intense emotions, Aïssatou goes back into the store to resume her work, thanking you profusely all the while. [[As you follow her in, she presents you with 250 acorns.|Post-Shift]]

As you finish your shift, you notice another crudely-cut clipping lying outside, and your fingertips tingle as you take it. You notice two sets of footprints, one slightly larger than the other, leading away from the shop and into the brush. You follow them briefly but fail to see anyone.

The paper reads:
//

- Repel man with cleaning product? (9)

- Harmful pattern of a violent bike? (7,5)

<<set $CrypticsDone = true>>\

As the last correct answer magically lodges itself into the paper, thousands upon thousands of colourful sparks pour out of the five sheets, flowing towards the shop's doorway in a bright cascade. Once they've made their way outside, they coalesce into a swirling column that reaches high into the air, past the trees' branches and into the sky.

Aïssatou stands outside with you and watches the spectacle in amazement.

"Why? Could it..."

All of a sudden, you hear voices nearby. You turn towards the source of the noise, somewhere in the brush, but don't see anyone.

Aïssatou falls to her knees beside you and you look back towards the approaching chatter. This time you notice two pairs of feet slowly walking towards you. They're accompanied by two pairs of hands that sway back and forth, one pair higher in the air than the other. There is silence for a few moments as they draw near, then a melodic female voice energetically yells out:

"Aïssatou! You have completed our challenge!"

Aïssatou, still on the ground, looks confused.

"Challenge?"

A deep male voice joins in.

"The challenge we gave you, so that you may prove your desire to start making amends!"

Aïssatou blinks and rubs her chin in thought.

"...Did you not read the note we wrote for you?"

"What note?"

The taller figure appears to cross her arms, while the other one shrugs.

"But I thought... hmm. Well, no matter. What's important is that you have worked hard to solve the puzzles that we selected."

Aïssatou's shoulders droop.

"Actually... it wasn't me."

The papers still in your hands, you feel scrutinized by the two figures. Aïssatou speaks up again.

"I'm sorry, I swear that I would have if I'd known! I've been preparing for a while now..."

Frantically motioning everyone present to wait, she flies back into the store, and the figures whisper to each other while she's gone. [[She soon reappears, carrying a large satchel.|Apology]]

:: Explanation {"position":"1850,100","size":"100,100"}
"My schedule is extremely flexible as I always have small tasks to delegate, whether the shop is open or closed. You could come in at any time and would be compensated for any shifts that you can complete. I wouldn't mind if you made mistakes — those can always be rectified — but exceptionally diligent work would be rewarded with a few extra acorns!"

She points to her wall calendar as she concludes.

"Lastly, starting on October 13th, I'll be closing the store for a week to get through the full moon. If you were able to work at least five shifts before then, that would give me enough time to get everything ready."

She accompanies you outside, and after a brief tour of the area around the shop, she points you in the direction of the tree you came from.

"Thank you so much for hearing me out; all I ask is that you think it over. If you do want to take me up on my offer, you can come by whenever you're free and I'll give you a bit of work!"

[''Note to player'': As you're starting a playthrough close to October 13, depending on schedule you might not have enough time to work five shifts by the end of October 12. Sincere apologies for any inconvenience! Other parts of the game will remain available until October 16, and it will be possible to play the shifts again after the end of IFComp (for more details, see the help/FAQ section in the sidebar). It's possible to work more than one shift on most days of the week, if you wish to do so, as new shifts become available whenever the store opens or closes independently of calendar days.]

"You're welcome to come work a few shifts at the store once the Hunter's Moon is behind us — assuming you're still interested, of course — and I'm sure our regular customers would love to meet you. But for now I'll think of something else I can have you do while I've got my hands full!"

:: Find Sheet {"position":"2000,100","size":"100,100"}
As you're about to part ways with Aïssatou, you spot a sheet of paper on the ground. She also takes notice and walks back towards you.

On closer inspection, it appears to be a crudely-cut clipping from some kind of print publication. Your fingertips tingle as you pick it up, and underneath it you notice a much smaller scrap of a differently-coloured paper. On it is a printed URL accompanied by the words <a href="https://s.wsj.net/blogs/html/wsjcrypticguide.pdf " target="_blank"> //GUIDE TO CRYPTIC CLUES//</a>.

You look at the larger sheet and find a short list of very peculiar sentences:
//
- Small demon exposed to oxygen is weakened (8)

- Small demon performs hits (7)

- Simply contains a small demon (3) //

Aïssatou's eyes narrow as she slowly runs a hand over the surface of the paper, leaving a glittery trail which quickly fades away.

"This feels like one of my spells, but I've never seen this sheet before... I'd like to examine it further. I'll file it away in the counter drawer at the store, if you want to come take a look later!"

As you part ways again, you decide what you want to do next.

:: First Meeting {"position":"1550,100","size":"100,100"}
You push open the door and are greeted by a cheerful voice.

"!السلام عليكم"

Your eyes are drawn to a figure in the center of the room. A prickling warmth makes its way deep inside your ears, and the unfamiliar sounds quickly become perfectly intelligible.

"Welcome to my shop!"

The woman smiles warmly as she approaches you, and you take a moment to examine her.

She is very short, and moves so effortlessly and gracefully that you could swear she was floating. Her skin is inhumanly white and seems almost pearlescent. Her tightly-coiled silver hair is woven into elegant and intricate braids.

You take in the sights, sounds and smells of the shop. Its disparate wooden shelves bear an incredible assortment of objects both magical and mundane, and the room is illuminated by the glow of various enchantments. A pleasant herbal scent lingers in the air.

Your attention is brought back to the woman as she introduces herself.

"My name is Aïssatou and I am the steward of this sanctuary. It's a lovely surprise to receive a visitor such as yourself!"

There's a moment of silence as she considers you carefully, scanning your features with her piercing eyes. She continues:

<<if new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-CA') < "2024-10-05">>\

:: Forest {"position":"1250,100","size":"100,100"}
You take the next few steps in darkness. Suddenly the air feels different on your skin and the smell of tropical flowers and fir needles envelops you. The gentle sound of running water reaches your ears.

You open your eyes and are greeted by the sight of a small creek flowing through a lush forest of mixed trees. Nearby, a fox and a hare are sleeping, curled up together on the grass. In the distance, a turkey and a kookaburra sing in harmony.

:: Frequently Asked Questions {"position":"700,300","size":"100,100"}
This section is meant to clarify any points that have caused issues for players. I'm very sorry for any confusion!

Notes on the save system and the game's accessibility can be found in the "About" section of the sidebar.

''How does the schedule work?''
The store's opening hours correspond to your real-world time and date. Opening the game during any given timeslot (i.e. a block of time where the store is open or closed) will let you work the associated shift. The maximum number of shifts per day ranges from 1 to 3 depending on the schedule.

''How can I tell when I'm done with the game? Do I have to solve all the cryptic clues?''
This game is the kind that never really ends — at least until mid-October — so please feel free to play as little or as much as you feel like! The 6-session minimum (intro + 5 shifts) is meant to give any player the chance to experience some sort of closure, find all the cryptic sheets, and earn enough to purchase at least one bead. But there is content for every possible shift, so players are encouraged to keep coming back if they're enjoying themselves or wish to make additional purchases. The cryptic puzzles are an optional challenge which grant a small reward and an extra bit of story.

''I'm waiting in the store for a new shift to start, but nothing is happening!''
There isn't currently a direct way to get from one shift to the next, but once a new timeslot rolls over and you're ready to leave the post-shift screen, you should be able to close out of the game and reopen it in order to see your new shift. The "Restart" button is another way to accomplish this.

''Can I ever catch up on what I missed? What happens if I can't work 5 shifts by October 12?''
Those who can't work 5 shifts by the end of October 12 will unfortunately miss out on part of the game experience, but should still be able to purchase a magical bead or two if they wish. More broadly, anyone who has already started playing and wishes to see some of the shifts they missed can come back to the game from October 17 onward to access a special mode that allows skipping between timeslots (though the post-shift actions will be disabled at this time).
A permanent post-comp release with a different progression system is also planned and will be uploaded <a href="https://zophobas-morio.itch.io/apothecary" target="_blank">to this itch.io page</a> once it's ready.

''I have a question or issue not listed here''

You enter the store. Aïssatou, busy filling out an exceedingly lengthy scroll that runs off the table she's sitting at, only asks you to help her water the many potted plants scattered around the room.

As you set down your watering can, a tall and thin man slinks in through the front door. His beautiful long and smooth hair is almost as fair as his skin. You approach him and notice that he is soaking wet. On his back is a beautiful, ornate, eight-stringed fiddle.

"<<if new Date().getHours() >= 7 and new Date().getHours() < 19>>Good day!<<else>>Good evening!<</if>> I'm happy to finally meet the new assistant! I hope you've been enjoying yourself. I'm Åsmund..."

His gaze absentmindedly skips from shelf to shelf as he continues:

"I'm looking for a present for a dear friend of mine, who always kindly hosts me... I already have a good idea of what I want, but I'd love your advice for colour-matching, because I can't differentiate between most hues."

You enter the shop and are sent outside to help remove debris from the windows.

You see two figures approaching, each pulling a small handcart down the same silty path you always take. The first in line, a young woman wearing a knee-length tunic, waves energetically as she calls out to you.

"Hey! Are you the new helper? Glad to have you! We're here for a delivery."

They come to a stop near the building and start unloading their carts. Bucketfuls of textiles, a cornucopia of fruit, healing ointments and all kinds of other goods are deposited near the door.

"I'm Ovidia, by the way, and this is Suādurīx!"

Her companion, a shy-looking man who moves with methodical intent, gives you a shaky smile from under the hood of his long cloak. You notice a lovely medium-sized white bird on his shoulder, who coos enthusiastically as you admire him.

"Oh, and that's Valens!"

They're already nearly done with their work, and you help them carry some things inside the building. You're picking up a small box full of blank keys when Ovidia suddenly speaks up.

"Wait! Don't take that one yet!"

You stop and [[turn towards her.|_NextPassage]]

<<else>>\
You enter the shop and are soon sent back outside to help remove debris from the windows.

Someone calls out to you and you turn to see Ovidia and Suādurīx approaching the giant tree with their handcarts. Valens flies ahead of them and lands on your shoulder, tweeting a cheerful greeting.

Once everyone has gathered, you all get to work. Bucketfuls of vegetables, concoctions and other goods are deposited near the door, and [[you help bring products into the building.|_NextPassage]]

"I dropped something in there earlier and I still have to look for it."

Suādurīx suddenly pipes up.

"Oh? What did you drop?"

"...my house key."

A smile creeps across his face, but he does an admirable job of containing it. Valens is not so tactful and loudly whistles in amusement.

You all lean over the box and attempt to find the key that's different from the others.

As you pick up a familiar little box filled with blank keys, Ovidia pulls out her own key and waves it around proudly.

"This time my own key is safe and sound with me! Haha–"

Suddenly the key slips out of her grasp and flies in a perfect arc, landing squarely in the box. There's a moment of silence as everyone processes what just happened, then contagious snickers from Suādurīx and Valens. Ovidia laughs self-deprecatingly.

You all lean over the box and attempt to find the key that's different from the others.

You enter the store and find Aïssatou hunched over a table, pensively examining an assortment of small glowing vials. Looking up from her work, she excitedly greets you.

"Hi! I'm so glad to see you. I need more materials for my experiments, but I still have too much work to do over here. If you wouldn't mind going out and collecting a sample for me, that would be incredibly helpful!"

She stretches across the table to pick up an empty vial, then walks over to you. 

"See, the spells that I use to sustain life and maintain harmony in these woods are working well enough, but there's still much room for improvement. I'd like to refine them, make them more powerful, more efficient. For that purpose I've been gathering magical energy from the forest's inhabitants, or sometimes from potent inanimate objects. Not much, only a tiny sliver at a time. Imperceptible to the creature, but groundbreaking for my research..."

She holds up the vial as she continues her explanation, keeping a finger securely pressed onto the cork.

"These vials are imbued with two spells. The first is a collection spell, which captures a fragment of energy from whatever your attention is focused on at the moment the cork is removed. The second is a locator spell, to help find a suitable donor; you'll feel the glass heat up slightly when a perfect specimen is nearby.
The bad news is that this kind of magic is volatile and will start to dissipate once you leave the building! But if your first attempt fails, don't worry — I can enchant another vial as needed."

She smiles warmly.

"With all that out of the way, let me see what I should send you out for..."

You enter the store and are excitedly greeted by Aïssatou, who is once again examining the glowing contents of an assortment of small vials.

"I'm so glad to see you! I've been making great progress in my spell research thanks to what you've brought me so far. There's something else I still need, if you have time to go look for it..."

She takes a cursory glance at her notes, periodically looking over at the full vials on the table.

"This time, I'd like to capture the dedication of an earwig!"

Equipped with a magic-infused vial and a hastily-scribbled informative note, you set out [[to find a suitable earwig|_NextPassage]].

Suddenly, the vial heats up under your fingertips!

You look around to find your target, and you get a good glance at two creatures who look similar. But the spell is running out, and you won't be able to examine them more closely before deciding what to bottle.

A tiny spark ignites as you remove the cork, and a colourful glowing mist fills the vial. The glass turns cold once again. You carefully make your way back to the store.

As soon as the words leave her mouth, she seems to regret them, and her tone turns apologetic.

"I'm sorry, you don't need to answer that right away. But the truth is, I've been struggling to manage the store on my own while preparing for the Hunter's Moon, and your arrival felt like the miracle I'd been hoping for! If you don't mind hearing me out, I'll let you go afterwards, with no obligation on your part."

She draws your attention to a small pile of acorns on a nearby counter. They emit a soft glow and seem to shimmer and change hues when you shift your gaze.

"This is the currency we use here; many of our residents are able to create them from regular seeds, at some personal cost. They're infused with a magic that can sustain and protect the life in this forest, as well as provide benefits to its magical inhabitants."

She rubs her chin, pensive.

"Ah, but I suppose you wouldn't have much use for them... unless..."

She ducks behind the counter and pulls out a small, worn chest. It opens to reveal six beautiful metal beads of varying shapes and hues.

"A long time ago, the inhabitants of these woods came together to craft various artifacts, as symbols of the new society we were creating. Most of these objects have already been claimed, but I was keeping this set aside for someone who could be deserving of them. If you earned enough acorns through helping me, I'd be happy to trade you some of these beads as a token of our gratitude! And if you wanted food or any other supplies from the shop, it would be yours — though you'll find that you won't need to eat as long as you're here."

The stone is currently smooth and intact.

A hammer and chisel lie on the ground. Do you pick them up?

After you've collected your pay, Aïssatou takes you aside for a moment.

"That was the fifth shift you've worked, and thanks to you, I already feel a lot more prepared for the full moon! Words can't convey how much I appreciate your assistance; it was truly a relief to be able to delegate all of those small tasks that were putting pressure on me."

She gestures towards the rest of the shop as she continues:

"Please don't feel obligated to keep coming in, but any additional help would certainly be very welcome. There's always more to do. And we always love to have you here with us!"

You enter the store and find Aïssatou hunched over a table, pensively examining an assortment of small glowing vials. Looking up from her work, she excitedly greets you.

"Hi! I'm so glad to see you. I need more materials for my experiments, but I still have too much work to do over here. If you wouldn't mind going out and collecting a sample for me, that would be incredibly helpful!"

She stretches across the table to pick up an empty vial, then walks over to you. 

"See, the spells that I use to sustain life and maintain harmony in these woods are working well enough, but there's still much room for improvement. I'd like to refine them, make them more powerful, more efficient. For that purpose I've been gathering magical energy from the forest's inhabitants, or sometimes from potent inanimate objects. Not much, only a tiny sliver at a time. Imperceptible to the creature, but groundbreaking for my research..."

She holds up the vial as she continues her explanation, keeping a finger securely pressed onto the cork.

"These vials are imbued with two spells. The first is a collection spell, which captures a fragment of energy from whatever your attention is focused on at the moment the cork is removed. The second is a locator spell, to help find a suitable donor; you'll feel the glass heat up slightly when a perfect specimen is nearby.
The bad news is that this kind of magic is volatile and will start to dissipate once you leave the building! But if your first attempt fails, don't worry — I can enchant another vial as needed."

She smiles warmly.

"With all that out of the way, let me see what I should send you out for..."

You enter the store and find Aïssatou brewing potions in a far corner of the room. She delegates a few small tasks to you while she works.

You're casually stocking some shelves when a distant high-pitched voice breaks your focus. It quickly gets louder and the door soon opens, revealing a woman and a boy with beautiful russet skin and smooth dark brown hair.
Her gait is unusual, and you immediately notice that she seems to have no feet — another glance reveals that her heel is in the front and her toes are pointing backwards towards the doorway. Flaps of skin stretch between her body and her arms; the latter end in elegant long-fingered hands whose palms face away from each other.

Your ears can suddenly make out words in the child's excited babble. 

"And then Ligaya said that she-"

"Just a moment, honey."

The boy grows quiet and stares at you, wide-eyed. She smiles apologetically.

"You must be the new assistant; it's nice to meet you. I'm Minviluz, and this is my son Bayani."

After a slight hesitation, she continues:
"The assistants who came before you used to read to him while I shop, and he always looked forward to it so much. If it's not too much trouble, would you mind doing the same? I think Aïssatou keeps the book behind the counter."

Aïssatou distractedly waves from across the room and gestures her approval.

You place a thumb over one of them and it tickles your skin. Feeling a sudden urge to think of a verb, you let the word THINK fill your head as you swipe your thumb sideways.

//Once upon a time, there was a boy born of a humble family who was named– //

"Bayani!"

//–who was named Bayani the <<print $MadLib1.toUpperFirst()>>.

He punctuates your tale with gasps and laughter. The story ends right on time, as Minviluz places a final item (a sapphire-encrusted silver bracelet) into her bag.

"Yanoi? Are you ready to go?"

"Coming!"

He politely thanks you and beams with happiness as he waves goodbye.

The pair engage in conversation again as they leave.

"Can we have a picnic with Mr. Åsmund soon?"

"I think so, sweetheart! I'll ask him tonight, okay?"

The sound of their voices slowly fade, and the store is quiet once again. Aïssatou thanks you for humoring Bayani.

You enter the shop and are sent outside to help remove debris from the windows.

You see two figures approaching, each pulling a small handcart down the same silty path you always take. The first in line, a young woman wearing a knee-length tunic, waves energetically as she calls out to you.

"Hey! Are you the new helper? Glad to have you! We're here for a delivery."

They come to a stop near the building and start unloading their carts. Bucketfuls of textiles, a cornucopia of fruit, healing ointments and all kinds of other goods are deposited near the door.

"I'm Ovidia, by the way, and this is Suādurīx!"

Her companion, a shy-looking man who moves with methodical intent, gives you a shaky smile from under the hood of his long cloak. You notice a lovely medium-sized white bird on his shoulder, who coos enthusiastically as you admire him.

"Oh, and that's Valens!"

They're already nearly done with their work, and you help them carry some things inside the building. You're picking up a small box full of blank keys when Ovidia suddenly speaks up.

"Wait! Don't take that one yet!"

You stop and [[turn towards her.|_NextPassage]]

You enter the shop and are soon sent back outside to help remove debris from the windows.

Someone calls out to you and you turn to see Ovidia and Suādurīx approaching the giant tree with their handcarts. Valens flies ahead of them and lands on your shoulder, tweeting a cheerful greeting.

"I dropped something in there earlier and I still have to look for it."

Suādurīx suddenly pipes up.

"Oh? What did you drop?"

"...my house key."

A smile creeps across his face, but he does an admirable job of containing it. Valens is not so tactful and loudly whistles in amusement.

You all lean over the box and attempt to find the key that's different from the others.

As you pick up a familiar little box filled with blank keys, Ovidia pulls out her own key and waves it around proudly.

"This time my own key is safe and sound with me! Haha–"

Suddenly the key slips out of her grasp and flies in a perfect arc, landing squarely in the box. There's a moment of silence as everyone processes what just happened, then contagious snickers from Suādurīx and Valens. Ovidia laughs self-deprecatingly.

Bayani excitedly waves and gives you a big smile.

You take out the magical blue book and prepare to read to him once again. To your surprise, he puts a hand on the tome's cover and softly closes it.

"I don't wanna read today."

He cranes his neck to locate his mother on the other side of the store, then leans towards you and whispers conspiratorially.

"I wanna buy something!"

He holds up a cupped hand, showing you a single glowing acorn.

You [[lean in and listen to his request|_NextPassage]].


:: Mon OPEN - 6b [Alan] {"position":"2000,1100","size":"100,100"}

He explains that we wants to buy something in secret, and quickly gets to work trying to find the perfect item. While he's busy sneakily peeking at the contents of nearby shelves, Aïssatou discreetly calls you over.

"Don't worry about the price, okay? I'll cover it."

She then makes a show of putting away her knitting supplies and strikes up a suspiciously enthusiastic conversation with Minviluz.

Taking advantage of the distraction, Bayani makes his move. He runs up to the counter with a fistful of white flowers. You've only just finished telling him that he doesn't have to pay when his mother walks up behind him.

"Don't worry Yanoi, we're leaving soon! I just have to pay for these..."

He turns around and presents the bouquet to her.

"Surprise!!"

Looking incredibly touched, she drops her things on the counter and gives him a long hug.

"Oh, sweetheart! Thank you!"

As she embraces him, she looks over to Aïssatou and assures her that she'll pay for the flowers, but her concerns are waved away.

"Don't worry about it, Minviluz — you deserve it."

Flustered, she profusely expresses her gratitude.

As the pair get ready to leave, Bayani thanks you for your help, then suddenly looks pensive. Digging into his pocket, he takes his acorn back out and proudly presents it to you.

"It's a tip!"

You enter the store and find Aïssatou hunched over a table, pensively examining an assortment of small glowing vials. Looking up from her work, she excitedly greets you.

"Hi! I'm so glad to see you. I need more materials for my experiments, but I still have too much work to do over here. If you wouldn't mind going out and collecting a sample for me, that would be incredibly helpful!"

She stretches across the table to pick up an empty vial, then walks over to you. 

"See, the spells that I use to sustain life and maintain harmony in these woods are working well enough, but there's still much room for improvement. I'd like to refine them, make them more powerful, more efficient. For that purpose I've been gathering magical energy from the forest's inhabitants, or sometimes from potent inanimate objects. Not much, only a tiny sliver at a time. Imperceptible to the creature, but groundbreaking for my research..."

She holds up the vial as she continues her explanation, keeping a finger securely pressed onto the cork.

"These vials are imbued with two spells. The first is a collection spell, which captures a fragment of energy from whatever your attention is focused on at the moment the cork is removed. The second is a locator spell, to help find a suitable donor; you'll feel the glass heat up slightly when a perfect specimen is nearby.
The bad news is that this kind of magic is volatile and will start to dissipate once you leave the building! But if your first attempt fails, don't worry — I can enchant another vial as needed."

A tiny spark ignites as you remove the cork, and a colourful glowing mist fills the vial. The glass turns cold once again. You carefully make your way back to the store.
Aïssatou meets you at the door and excitedly collects your find.

"Welcome back!"

She raises the vial to her face and gazes deeply into it.

"Hmmm, something's not quite right... Oh!"
She smiles in amusement.
"I think you were bamboozled by a lookalike!"

You tell her about the two creatures that you saw.

"Ah, I see! The lookalike must have been a boar. Or maybe a peccary... I still struggle to tell them apart from afar!"

<<if $CreatureClicked == "A">>\
She thanks you warmly and wastes no time in starting her analysis.

You enter the store and are excitedly greeted by Aïssatou, who is once again examining the glowing contents of an assortment of small vials.

"I'm so glad to see you! I've been making great progress in my spell research thanks to what you've brought me so far. There's something else I still need, if you have time to go look for it..."

She takes a cursory glance at her notes, periodically looking over at the full vials on the table.

"This time, I'd like to capture a fox's excitement!"

Equipped with a magic-infused vial and a hastily-scribbled informative note, you set out [[to find a suitable fox|_NextPassage]].

As you start your search, you glance at the note that Aïssatou wrote for you:
<i>
Fox

</i>\

Suddenly, the vial heats up under your fingertips!

You look around to find your target, and you get a good glance at two creatures who look similar. But the spell is running out, and you won't be able to examine them more closely before deciding what to bottle.

You enter the store and start looking for Aïssatou. Shortly afterwards, a wisp of mist floats into view as a short, jolly-looking woman with rosy cheeks walks in. Her body is clad in thick layers of fuzzy moss in every shade of green, and small leafy twigs are delicately woven into her long, greying dark hair.

As she greets you in her deep and melodic voice, you can immediately understand her, and you're momentarily impressed by the efficacy of the comprehension spell. Then you realize that she is actually speaking English.

"Hello! You are the new employee! I am coming here sometimes on Sonnday, Monday and Diensday. Today I am bringing back to Aïssatou a rain-screen."

As if on cue, Aïssatou appears from behind a tall bookshelf.

"Irmgard! Thank you for bringing back my umbrella! How have you been?"

She turns to you.

"Could you please go store it in the bin behind the counter?"

You promptly put the umbrella in its place [[while listening to their conversation|_NextPassage]].

Minutes pass as the two friends catch up, and you're offered a cup of tea as you sit nearby and occasionally participate. As the conversation winds down, AÏssatou asks you to sort out a small pile of runic stones, then lets you go.

As Irmgard prepares to leave, citing a birthday party she has to organize, she bids you farewell and asks you one last question:

"Which cake do you think I should make? Apple, plum, rhubarb, poppy, or marble cake?"

[[– Apple. |_NextPassage][$CakeFlavour = "apple"]]

"Isn't she incredible? She must be the most multilingual person in the entire woods. Sometimes she speaks to me in Wolof, too. I think I enjoy that more than the spell!"

She goes back to her work, but you notice her looking over at her bookshelf pensively.

As you approach the counter once again, you notice that Aïssatou is nervously fiddling with a curl of her hair. Irmgard is rummaging through her own bag, and a moment later, she lifts up a large metal box that she hands to you.

"A present for both of you!"

As you hold the box, Aïssatou opens it to find a fresh $CakeFlavour cake. You see her mood shift from anxious to flustered. Irmgard chuckles jollily when she sees her reaction.

"I hope that you like it!"

Suddenly, Aïssatou speaks up. You feel the air inside your ears vibrate as the spell tries to keep up with her language.

"Dan... Danke? Das ist... gud!"

Irmgard clasps her hands in amazement. "Ah, gut gemacht! Sehr gut!"

You lose track of which languages they're speaking as the conversation continues in a mix of magically-translated questions and praise, punctuated by forkfuls of delicious cake. Aïssatou's pearlescent skin is uncharacteristically flushed and she looks equal parts happy and proud.

As Irmgard leaves, she reaches inside her bag once more and winks as she pulls something out.

"Look — this time, I have brought my own umbrella!"

Aïssatou laughs as she waves goodbye, then brings a small piece of cake to the stockroom before continuing her work. You hear happy, muffled squeaks coming from inside.

You come to a stop near what is unquestionably the tallest tree in the forest. Several of its gigantic roots emerge high above ground, and are tangled up so tightly that they seem to form walls. Gaps in their weaving patterns reveal a door and a few glass windows.

A gnarled plank of wood is nailed to the door, serving as a sign. The characters shift and morph in front of your eyes, and soon form familiar patterns.

Aïssatou greets you as you enter and promptly disappears into a hidden crevice between two shelves, asking you to watch the store while she works on something.

Small clouds of fog soon blow into the shop as a robust man with lightly-tanned, blemishless skin and long wavy red hair walks in. A small rounded wooden flute hangs at his hip.
You greet him and he enthusiastically responds, though you can't understand him yet. As he keeps talking in his pleasant booming voice, you notice that it takes longer than usual for the comprehension spell to kick in, and you miss most of the sentence.

"... with my friends."

You let him know about the spell issue and he repeats himself with a nod. However, some of his words still sound garbled.

"My name is Hau-tōrua and I'm looking for some //''able hearts''// to enjoy with my friends."

You ask him to confirm what he wants.

"Some //''able hearts''//, please! To share with everyone!"

He tries to write it out on a scrap of paper, but it is evidently not enchanted and you can't understand the script he writes in.

His eyes light up as you bring a set of herbal teas out of the stockroom.

"Yes, that's just what I wanted! Thank you! I'm impressed that you were able to figure it out."
<<else>>\
Amusement and confusion mix on his face as he watches you come out of the stockroom. You quickly realize that you're holding the wrong item, and another attempt allows you to locate the herbal teas that he wanted.

"Thank you for bearing with me! I'm glad we managed to figure it out in the end."

<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/a$/,"b")>>\

Aïssatou greets you as you enter and asks you to hold some new books for her as she sorts them into a bookcase.

When Hau-tōrua comes in with his entourage of fog and his jolly demeanor, she greets him happily. The interference is worse than ever as he speaks:

"Hello! //''... ... countermark chai nigiri ...''//"

Aïssatou's eyes widen and she distractedly sets the books aside.

"Whoa! Hang on... I'll be right back!"

She runs to a large wooden chest at the back of the room, and [[you hear the clinking of glass as she rummages through it.|_NextPassage]]


:: Patupaiarehe 4b {"position":"6500,900","size":"100,100"}
<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/b$/,"c")>>\

"Aha!"

She triumphantly holds up a large vial as she runs back. It appears to be empty, save for a peculiar iridescent shimmer that catches your eye whenever she tilts it.

She cracks open the front door and twirls her index outside, deftly wrapping a wisp of fog around it. When she uncorks the vial and dips her finger in, tiny colourful sparks erupt and flicker. They spread across the fog, dissolving it like wet candy floss.

After giving the vial one last swirl for good measure, she flies up and pours the glimmering mixture on Hau-tōrua. It lightly settles across his skin and quickly fades away.

He hesitantly starts to speak again:

"I was asking for a miniature rocking chair?..."

Cheers erupt as Aïssatou celebrates the spell's success.

You fetch the rocking chair [[and Hau-tōrua thanks you heartily.|_NextPassage]]


:: Patupaiarehe 4c {"position":"6600,900","size":"100,100"}
He puts his purchase away and excitedly gushes about the lizard that it's meant for. 

As he prepares to leave, Aïssatou makes an apology, her eyes flitting back and forth between the two of you.

"I'm sorry I never realized that there was magical interference going on! I thought I already had all of those kinks ironed out..."

He laughs it off and happily bids you farewell. Aïssatou still looks a bit flustered, but she smiles at you as she gets back to her book sorting.

This game was meant to be enjoyed during IFComp 2024 and cannot currently be played outside of the IFComp dates, as it relies on the player's system clock.
A version with a different progression system (in addition to other changes and improvements) is currently in development! There are also plans for a potential sequel or expansion, if there's enough interest.

The post-comp version will be published on this page, hopefully before the end of the year:
https://zophobas-morio.itch.io/apothecary
And will subsequently be uploaded to the IF Archive, then linked to this IFDB page:
https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=60bmufqvqaqav08b

News about the charity donations will be published on intfiction.org in the <a href="https://intfiction.org/c/competitions/7" target="_blank">Competitions forum</a> by the end of October.

You enter the store and find Aïssatou hunched over a table, pensively examining an assortment of small glowing vials. Looking up from her work, she excitedly greets you.

"Hi! I'm so glad to see you. I need more materials for my experiments, but I still have too much work to do over here. If you wouldn't mind going out and collecting a sample for me, that would be incredibly helpful!"

She stretches across the table to pick up an empty vial, then walks over to you. 

"See, the spells that I use to sustain life and maintain harmony in these woods are working well enough, but there's still much room for improvement. I'd like to refine them, make them more powerful, more efficient. For that purpose I've been gathering magical energy from the forest's inhabitants, or sometimes from potent inanimate objects. Not much, only a tiny sliver at a time. Imperceptible to the creature, but groundbreaking for my research..."

She holds up the vial as she continues her explanation, keeping a finger securely pressed onto the cork.

"These vials are imbued with two spells. The first is a collection spell, which captures a fragment of energy from whatever your attention is focused on at the moment the cork is removed. The second is a locator spell, to help find a suitable donor; you'll feel the glass heat up slightly when a perfect specimen is nearby.
The bad news is that this kind of magic is volatile and will start to dissipate once you leave the building! But if your first attempt fails, don't worry — I can enchant another vial as needed."

She smiles warmly.

"With all that out of the way, let me see what I should send you out for..."

<</if>>
She takes a cursory glance at her notes, periodically looking over at the full vials on the table.

"I'd like to capture the curiosity of a clam!"

Following the sound of a waterfall, you come across a mysterious cave, and find that on the other side it opens onto a rocky beach. The smell of saltwater reaches you as the sky and ocean stretch out before your eyes.

Suddenly, the vial heats up under your fingertips!

You look around to find your target, and you get a good glance at two creatures who look similar. But the spell is running out, and you won't be able to examine them more closely before deciding what to bottle.

You come to the mysterious cave once again, and follow it to its end. You walk across the rocky beach until you find a group of pool where freshwater turns brackish.

Suddenly, the vial heats up under your fingertips!

You look around to find your target, and you get a good glance at two creatures who look similar. But the spell is running out, and you won't be able to examine them more closely before deciding what to bottle.

"I hope those labels didn't give you too much trouble! I meant to have a talk with Ovidia about that but I keep missing her. I'm sure I can figure out a spell that works on numbers..."

You enter the store and find Aïssatou sitting in a chair, slumped against the table in front of her. You quickly realize that she's asleep. Her cheek is resting on a large open tome, and her hand is loosely wrapped around her reed pen.

As the door closes behind you, [[she wakes up.|_NextPassage]]


:: Sat OPEN - 6b [Special Other] {"position":"5200,1100","size":"100,100"}
<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/b$/,"c")>>\

"Oh dear... I'm sorry! I've been working so much lately..."

She rubs her eyes.

"Thankfully, it'll all be over soon — the week of the full moon is upon us, and starting tomorrow I'll be able to put the finishing touches on all my plans while the shop is shut down. And it's in great part thanks to you!"

She sighs contentedly, then silently regards you for a moment before speaking up again.

"Would you want to live here? In these woods, I mean."

You think about it, and answer that:

[[– You would.|_NextPassage][$Reside = 0]]
[[– You wouldn't.|_NextPassage][$Reside = 1]]
[[– You're not sure.|_NextPassage][$Reside = 2]]

<<if $Reside == 0>>\
A soft smile reaches her lips.
"Maybe once all of this is behind us, we can make room for you... I bet the others would be delighted."
<<elseif $Reside == 1>>\
She nods understandingly.
"To each their own! In any case, you're always welcome here as a visitor."
<<else>>\
She laughs softly.
"Well, there's no rush. If you ever need a new home, I'll be here."
<</if>>\

You chat a while longer, about the forest and about life. As she reluctantly picks her pen back up, she asks if you could bring her more spellmaking supplies before leaving. The table is soon overflowing with stones, flasks and all manner of implements.

Player participation will be aggregated in order to make a single donation to each organization shortly after the conclusion of IFComp 2024. All charities will receive a minimum amount, with player contributions adding a bonus sum. The current plan is for each in-game item purchased with acorns to count for 1$ U.S. in real-world donations.
Funds will be drawn from the author's IFComp 2023 prize money, as well as revenue from the sale of <a href="https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-55" target="_blank">Indiepocalypse #55</a> (and will be supplemented as needed in case of high participation).

You've barely set foot in the building when something big and fast brushes past you, disappearing into the shop.
Behind you, a voice calls out, and you turn to see a young man of short stature standing in the doorway. His vibrant russet skin hides toned muscles. His bright orange hair somehow stands upright, looking almost spiky, and glows with a vivid warm light.

He laughs breathlessly and kneels. You suddenly notice that his feet are pointing backwards, giving his movements a unique quality.

"Hey! Come back here!"

You hear quiet hoofsteps coming from behind a wooden display, and a friendly peccary soon appears. She happily hops into the man's arms while he beams at you.

"Hahaha, sorry about that! I'm Kauê, and this is my sister Kauane!"

She grunts enthustiastically as he tousles her hair. Aïssatou peeks out of the stockroom to check on the commotion and waves with a friendly smile.

"We're both starving and we heard there was a new employee, so we thought..." 

He waves back to Aïssatou and waits until she disappears into the stockroom again.

"...we thought maybe we could finally get a nice meal here!"

He keeps talking as he walks over to a nearby bookcase and pulls out a large binder.

"Don't get me wrong, she's amazing! But for her whole life until earlier this year, she's been served all of her meals. I think she's still too scared to even follow a simple recipe!"

He hands you the binder and claps gleefully. 

"We haven't busted this out in so long! I can't //wait//! If you can pick out a recipe, I'll help you make it."

The binder is full of mismatched pages of varying size and colour, with penmanship ranging from dainty and neat to chaotic and bold.

You take in the different recipes as you [[flip through the pages|_NextPassage]].

"Hey! Would you be up for cooking with us again?"

He holds out the binder of recipes with his arms stretched towards you, looking at you with stars in his eyes. Kauane gives you a friendly sniff and a pleading look.

"Yes, great idea! Let's get started! This is gonna be so yummy..."

He helps prepare the ingredients as you start cooking, and you soon have a delicious meal to share.

As Kauê scarfs down his food, Kauane feasts on a pile of fresh agave leaves topped with a small serving of the dish. A portion is set aside for Aïssatou, who thanks you profusely as she takes it into the stockroom to continue her work.

Shortly after you enter the shop, Aïssatou comes out of the stockroom to greet you.
"I'll have to be in there for a while again. As always, I really appreciate any help you can provide to the customers!"

It doesn't take long after her retreat for the front door to open. Kauê saunters in with his sister in tow.

"Hey! What's up? We have a party to get to, so we're just stopping by to grab some supplies."

Kauane dashes back outside as Kauê starts walking around the shop, amassing armfuls of snacks and drinks.

You're making small talk with him when suddenly your attention is drawn away, as [[Kauane nudges your leg|_NextPassage]].

<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/b$/,"c")>>\

You look down and see Kauane staring up at you, her tail wagging happily. The stem of a beautiful lily is delicately held between her teeth.

She flicks her head up repeatedly with quiet squeals, showing you the flower.

[[– You thank her and tuck the flower behind your ear. |_NextPassage][$FlowerClicked = "YourEar"]]

"Oh, by the way, thanks for all those delicious meals! Maybe after this whole full moon business is behind us, we could give Aïssatou some cooking lessons, eh?"

Turning towards Kauane as he heads towards the door, he exclaims:

"PARTY TIME!"

His hair catches fire in a sudden blast of heat while he claps and laughs. You watch it slowly fizzle out as the pair walk away.

"Hi! Would you mind throwing some of that powder on the lanterns outside? It keeps the flames from hurting nocturnal animals."

You quickly finish dusting the lanterns with the exceedingly fine powder, which makes them sparkle and shimmer in stunning cool hues.

As you're about to go back inside, a woman walks up to the front door. Her long hemp robe bears a simple yet striking pattern, and her very long and glossy black hair is tied into an elegant ponytail with a charming ribbon. <<if new Date().getHours() >= 7 and new Date().getHours() < 19>>A beautiful paper-like parasol protects her from the sun's rays.<<else>>She carries a beautiful paper-like parasol, currently closed.<</if>>

"It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Furusawa Matsu. You may call me Matsu."

After leaning her folded parasol near the entryway, she walks towards a bare section of the wall and hooks her fingers into a small groove in the wood. An entire panel slides open, revealing an alcove whose existence you never even suspected. Inside is a comfortable-looking mat and a small tea table.

She heads in and invites you to sit with her.

"I like to come here to have tea sometimes, and reflect on life. What Aïssatou has built here..."

She makes a sweeping gesture towards the rest of the store.

"... is amazing, but the cruelty and darkness of life outside our little oasis still bothers me. In order to feel at peace, I try to find hope in the big and small moments that I witness. Hope for me, or hope for the state of the world..."

She loses herself in thought for a moment, a slight smile on her lips.

"For example, last week I met a boy who is afraid of small critters. But when he saw a little life about to be trampled, he selflessly protected it. I admired his courage and his kindness."

She holds your gaze as she softly asks:

"See, the spells that I use to sustain life and maintain harmony in these woods are working well enough, but there's still much room for improvement. I'd like to refine them, make them more powerful, more efficient. For that purpose I've been gathering magical energy from the forest's inhabitants, or sometimes from potent inanimate objects. Not much, only a tiny sliver at a time. Imperceptible to the creature, but groundbreaking for my research..."

She holds up the vial as she continues her explanation, keeping a finger securely pressed onto the cork.

"These vials are imbued with two spells. The first is a collection spell, which captures a fragment of energy from whatever your attention is focused on at the moment the cork is removed. The second is a locator spell, to help find a suitable donor; you'll feel the glass heat up slightly when a perfect specimen is nearby.
The bad news is that this kind of magic is volatile and will start to dissipate once you leave the building! But if your first attempt fails, don't worry — I can enchant another vial as needed."

She smiles warmly.

"With all that out of the way, let me see what I should send you out for..."

You enter the store and are excitedly greeted by Aïssatou, who is once again examining the glowing contents of an assortment of small vials.

"I'm so glad to see you! I've been making great progress in my spell research thanks to what you've brought me so far. There's something else I still need, if you have time to go look for it..."

She takes a cursory glance at her notes, periodically looking over at the full vials on the table.

"I'd like to capture a millipede's hugs!"

Equipped with a magic-infused vial and a hastily-scribbled informative note, you set out [[to find a suitable millipede|_NextPassage]].

You look around to find your target, and you get a good glance at two creatures who look similar. But the spell is running out, and you won't be able to examine them more closely before deciding what to bottle.

"The tapestry of spells that keeps these woods alive has been several decades in the making. I'm very proud of it and always looking to improve! I think my greatest accomplishment is discovering a type of magic that can provide sustenance to every kind of creature, and even allow them to thrive in unnatural environments. You may also have noticed that our days always have twelve hours, from 7 to 7."

<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/a$/,"b")>>\

You enter the store and find Aïssatou pouring tea for a customer: a stout woman with skin the colour and texture of tree bark. Her stunning long hair, which almost resembles quills, is held back by a pretty bandana. Her bright eyes sparkle warmly as she smiles at you.

"Greetings! You can call me Weetamoo. Would you like to have tea with me?"

Aïssatou places a second cup on the counter and excuses herself. Weetamoo nods to her, then turns back to you as she keeps talking.

"I do love drinking tea, but in truth what I am interested in at the moment is the loose leaves at the bottom of the cup. It is said that one can glimpse a thread of the tapestry of fate by interpreting these leaves. Perhaps we could practice together."

Weetamoo spends a moment gazing into her own cup before shifting her attention to yours, once you've finished drinking its contents.

The two of you admire the small leaves scattered at the bottom of the cup in a distinctive pattern:

''SURPRISE !''

Aïssatou' bubbly laughter echoes through the room, and you look up to find Weetamoo breaking out in a good-natured grin. She holds up a small bottle filled with a swirling amber dust.

"We have a confession to make — we were the ones behind the tea's magic. In truth, it hasn't yet been proven that divination is possible. But we were so excited to finally add a new member to our community that we wanted to dazzle you with a little trick!"

AÏssatou walks up behind her and gently takes the bottle. "Look at what it can do!"

She uncorks the bottle. In a burst of golden light, [[a tiny replica of herself appears on her shoulder.|_NextPassage]]


:: Tue OPEN - 6c [Pukwudgie] {"position":"2900,1100","size":"100,100"}
The tiny Aïssatou smiles and waves at you, then floats down to the table and skips around the cups. She proceeds to dive into the teapot, but you notice that the liquid doesn't ripple when she touches it. Weetamoo chuckles at the sight.

The real Aïssatou snaps her fingers and her replica turns into a small bird. Once more for a teacup. With a flick of the hand, it blinks out of existence.

"It might not be divination, but isn't illusion magic still pretty neat?" She gives you a warm, happy smile. "Thank you for being such a good sport and playing along. We feel very lucky to have you here with us."

Weetamoo soon says her goodbyes and leaves the store, taking another pouch of tea with her (purely for drinking, she clarifies). Aïssatou disappears into the stockroom, asking you to put the cups on the counter before leaving.

As you wrap up, you notice a tattered sheet of paper under the table. As you pick it up, you immediately recognize the handwritten words:

<i>If you seek access to the woods of sanctuary
the forest where baobabs and longleaf pines entwine their roots
and the call of the hawk is answered by the dove ...</i>

But your own note is still in your possession.

When you enter the store, you find Aïssatou sitting at a table, writing in a large book.

"Oh, hello! I'm glad you could come in today! While the store is closed I usually take the opportunity to do some deep cleaning and check our inventory. But I've been a little overwhelmed lately, so your help would be much appreciated."

She swiftly makes her way across the room and pulls out a few sheets of paper from behind the counter. As she hands them to you, she gestures towards a broom near the door.

"Would you mind doing a quick sweep of the stockroom and checking every item on the list? Diégane can help you with the high shelves; just call him when it's time."

You gather your supplies and prepare to [[enter the stockroom|_NextPassage]].


:: Tue/Thu CLOSED - 1b {"position":"3200,600","size":"100,100"}
<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/b$/,"c")>>\

As you push open the door, you're struck by how spacious the stockroom is. The far wall bends outwards in a vast half-circle and extends upwards many meters above your head, where it tapers into a narrow slice of ceiling. Indistinct blobs of light slowly bob and shift along various surfaces, bathing the tall and heavybuilt wooden shelves in their soft glow. No one else seems to be around.

You start sweeping in earnest and find that the broom magically absorbs any dust you disturb, allowing you to finish your cleanup in record time.

Moving on to the inventory list, you quickly hit a wall as you finish checking the quantities of everything within your reach. There are no ladders in sight, but you notice a dainty little silver bell hanging near the door. The letter D is engraved on its handle.

[[– Ring the bell.|_NextPassage][$RatRing = 0]]

You pick up the dainty bell and give it a few shakes. Ding! Ding! Ding!
<<else>>
You call out: "Diégane?"
<</if>>\

From the top of the highest shelf comes a loud scratching noise. Just a moment later, a small fuzzy shape comes into view. You can just barely make out two shiny eyes looking down at you.

The face disappears and you hear scurrying and clanging, getting ever closer. With a startling series of squeaks, the little creature suddenly appears on a wooden beam next to you! He appears to be a rat of some kind.

He leans towards the sheet of paper you're holding, and his lush brown fur tickles your arm as you let him have a look. He darts back up the shelves, climbing around with surprising speed. He promptly makes it back to you and sniffs at the first item on the page as he waggles his tail.

Thud. Thud. Thud.
Three slaps of the tail against the wood.

Dashing away and returning once more, he sniffs at the second item. 

Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.

He looks up at you meaningfully. This must be his way of helping!

With Diégane's help, you make short work of the rest of the items. As you thank him and prepare to leave, you spot in the corner of the room a few unique items that were not on the list:

an adorably diminutive pipe organ,
an admirably gargantuan hapsichord,
and a confusingly small grand piano.

It might be a good idea to take note of them, in case someone asks about it later.

Aïssatou is stocking a shelf of assorted herbs when you enter.

"Hi! I've got my hands full right now, but if you wouldn't mind doing a stockroom sweep and inventory check again, that would be great! The list is in the usual spot.

As you prepare to enter the stockroom, she turns to you.

"Hey, the last time you were in there, did you happen to see some musical instruments? A customer is asking about that last batch again. Anything we had back then should still be in the stockroom now, but we'll have to dig it out of the alcove. Do you remember which of these we had?"

<<set _NextPassage = passage().replace(/b$/,"c")>>\

You open the door to find Diégane already waiting for you. He playfully chases the broom as you sweep, then diligently darts between shelves in a flurry of movement to help you check the list in record time.

As you wrap up, you notice that the unique instruments you saw last time are gone from view, and in their place are a few others:

a hilariously tiny violin,
a delightfully microscopic guitar,
and a wonderfully miniature harp.

Diégane sniffs at them and excitedly skips around.

Aïssatou soon joins you, and [[you enter the alcove where the old instruments are piled up.|_NextPassage]]

"Our customer should be very happy! It'll be lovely to hear more music around the forest."

As you emerge from the stockroom, you're surprised to find <<if $FossSeen == 1>>Åsmund<<else>>a tall and pale man with long, drenched blond hair<</if>> standing in the shop's entryway. He gives you a small nod and a smile.

"Åsmund! Welcome! He's waiting for you back there."

You feel something move near your feet and you look down to see Diégane holding a wonderfully miniature harp in his tiny hands. He squeaks happily as Åsmund enters the stockroom, and faint string melodies soon fill the air.
